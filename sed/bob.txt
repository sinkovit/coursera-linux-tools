This is a story about Bob and how Bob decided to create a Coursera
class to introduce students Linux text processing tools. Bob started
working on this project in 2025 and was ready to launch his LINUX
course before the end of the year. Although Bob felt that he
understood the linux tools, Bob needed help with the video production.
