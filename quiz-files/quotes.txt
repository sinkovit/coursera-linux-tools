This file contains "quoted strings". We're going to use
lazy matching to find the "text" that appears between "quotes".
As you can see "this" gets a "little" complicated when
"there are" multiple "sets of quotes on" a line.
I'm adding a "few" more "lines" with "quoted" strings
"just" to "make things" a "little" "more" "interesting",
"thereby" making "it" "harder" to "look" at the file
"and" count all the "quoted" "strings".
