I enjoy walking my dog, while eating a snack and listening to
music. She enjoys seeing squirrels, sniffing the ground and searching
for lizards. After the walk, she looks forward to drinking water,
chewing her toys and dreaming about her big adventure. While
strolling, we spend time talking to the neighbors and barking at other
dogs. I am working on her training so that she will stop pulling on her
leash. Ever since we adopted her, going for walks and being outside
are her favorite activities.
