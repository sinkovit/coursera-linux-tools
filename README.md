# coursera-linux-tools

This GitHub repo contains the files and	commands that you'll need to
execute the exercises and perform the graded assignments associated
with the Coursera class [Linux Tools for Text
Processing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linux-tools-for-text-processing)

If you're using the GNU Coreutils, which are distributed with most major and many minor Linux distros, the examples should work as is. Note that this includes Ubuntu, which is used when launching Binder. Unfortunately, the Linux man pages are not available when using Ubuntu. We're looking into how to address this and suggest that you access the man pages online.

On the other hand, if you're working in a Linux-like environment, you may find that some tools (e.g., shuf), options (e.g., verbose -v and quiet -q modes for head and tail) and capabilities (e.g., Perl compatible regular expressions with grep) will be unavailable. Mac users may want to consider using Homebrew to install Coreutils.
